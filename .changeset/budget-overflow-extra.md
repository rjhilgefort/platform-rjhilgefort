feat: overflow from normal budgets into Extra time when depleted

- Normal budget timers (TV, Games) now overflow into Extra time when depleted
- Only Extra can go negative (to be earned back later)
- New visual indicator when using Extra time during active timer
- Settings page now polls balances every 30s to stay in sync
