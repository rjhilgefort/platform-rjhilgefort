I feel safe dropping my child off here. My son has made great friendships and relationships with every teacher he has had here. I am so beyond thankful for every one of their staff, the directors and owner of Bright Future.\n\nBright Future does all they can to be involved in my child's every day care. I enjoy daily updates on how my son is in class and I love getting pictures on their app! I love this place! My son and I are excited for the upcoming dance class they will be having at their center in April!!!! I always recommend Bright Future to anyone in need of child care.\n\nTHANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO FOR MY CHILD BRIGHT FUTURE!!!",

        "I have now sent two children to this facility and I love the care and attention they have gotten! All of the staff is very caring and really gets to know all of the kids. My daughter learned so much, especially in Ms. Sydney's class! She works with all the kiddos and teaches them new things every day and we get updates on everything. She was more than prepared for when she went to preschool. We sent our baby here and Ms. Linda is very caring and works hard to help my little one advance and hit milestones! She is constantly doing tummy time and getting the love and attention she needs/deserves. We also love the director, Ms. Stephanie! She is always working hard to improve the facility and we have already seen so much good chance since she has come into the position. We weren't supposed to go to this daycare (the one we waited 6 months on a waiting list for changed their policy last minute causing us to switch) and we are so happy we did! Bright Future has always taken good care of our kiddos. As another pro: they are one of the few daycares in the area to take part time kids! So important for someone like me who didn't need full time. Such a life saver when it comes to saving money on daycare prices.",
